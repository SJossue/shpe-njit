## Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Website (Easiest)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# If you haven't already, initialize git and push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Import to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your `shpe-njit` repository from GitHub
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a Create React App

6. Done! Your site will be live in ~2 minutes

**Your site will be at:** `https://shpe-njit.vercel.app` (or similar)

---

## Option 2: Deploy via Command Line

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
```bash
npx vercel login
```
Follow the prompts to authenticate.

### Step 2: Deploy Preview (Test Deployment)
```bash
npm run deploy:preview
```
This creates a preview deployment for testing.

### Step 3: Deploy to Production
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This deploys to production!

---

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### If you want to use `shpenjit.org` or another domain:

1. Go to your project in Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow Vercel's instructions to update your DNS settings
5. Wait for DNS to propagate (can take up to 48 hours)

---

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected to GitHub, Vercel will automatically:
- Deploy every push to `main` branch to production
- Create preview deployments for pull requests
- Run your build and tests

---

## Environment Variables (If Needed Later)

If you need to add API keys or secrets:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Add variables like `REACT_APP_API_KEY`
3. Redeploy to apply changes

---

## Updating Your Website

Once deployed, updating is simple:

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update website content"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy!

---

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production (test locally)
npm run build

# Deploy preview version
npm run deploy:preview

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails on Vercel?
- Check that `npm run build` works locally first
- Look at build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Routing issues (404 on refresh)?
- Already configured in `vercel.json` - should work!
- The rewrite rule sends all requests to `index.html`

### Need help?
- Check [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
- Contact: [Vercel Support](https://vercel.com/support)
